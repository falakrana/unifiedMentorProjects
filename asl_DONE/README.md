# 🖐️ Sign Language Detection using CNN 🚀  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **deep learning-based Sign Language Detection System** that recognizes hand signs from the **American Sign Language (ASL) dataset** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is trained on a labeled dataset to classify hand gestures accurately.  

### 🎯 Key Features  
✔️ **Real-time ASL Sign Detection** using a webcam  
✔️ **Trained CNN Model** for high accuracy recognition  
✔️ **Automated Sign Language Translation**  
✔️ **Supports Multi-Class Classification**  
✔️ **Robust Against Different Hand Positions & Backgrounds**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
🔹 **Python** – Core programming language  
🔹 **TensorFlow/Keras** – Deep learning framework  
🔹 **OpenCV** – Image processing & real-time video capture  
🔹 **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling
