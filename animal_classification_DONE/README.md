# üêæ Animal Classification using TensorFlow & CNN

This project is an **Animal Classification System** built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with the powerful **TensorFlow** framework. The goal is to classify various animals from images into their respective categories, achieving high accuracy by training a CNN model on a dataset of animal images.

## üìã Project Overview

In this project, we implement a CNN model to classify animal images into different categories. The model is trained using TensorFlow, a deep learning framework, and the images are pre-processed before being fed into the model. This classifier can be used for real-time image classification of animals.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Animal Classification**: Classify various animals from uploaded images.
- **TensorFlow & CNN**: Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to achieve high accuracy.
- **Pre-trained Model**: The model is trained on a diverse dataset of animal images.
- **Easy to use**: Upload your image, and the model classifies it in seconds!
